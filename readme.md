# Portfolio Website Project
### Mobile design (First milestone)

> This is the first milestone of the portfolio website project. This is not an actual mobile website. It's just a mobile-like mock-up based on the figma design we were provied. The project will grow to a actual portfolio website someday. 

> One thing I want to share about the CSS. Back in 2017, I was learning flex-box for the first time. The I tried to build my own lighweight CSS famework based on flex-box. That project help me lot. I used many helper classes from that stylesheet here. That piece of code is open source, anyone can use that. I named it "Flexy Framework". The link is given below.
